### 1. **Introduction Update**
- **Removed**: Reference to pre-trained LoRA adapters being available
- **Added**: Emphasis on hands-on training experience (5-10 minutes for small dataset)
- **Added**: List of skills users will gain from actual training

### 2. **NeMo Installation Section**
- **Removed**: Suggestion to skip training and use pre-trained adapters
- **Updated**: Clarified that full NeMo installation is optional - scripts work with existing environment

## Key Philosophy Changes

### Before:
- Presented training as optional/complex
- Offered shortcuts with pre-trained adapters
- Focused on saving time

### After:
- Training is the main experience
- Emphasizes hands-on learning
- Celebrates the achievement of training their own model

## Training Timeline
- Model loading: ~30 seconds
- Training 50 steps: ~5-10 minutes
- Total experience: Under 15 minutes

This ensures every participant gets the full experience of training and deploying their own custom AI model!
