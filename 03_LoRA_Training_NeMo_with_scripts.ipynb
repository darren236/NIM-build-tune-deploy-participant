    "\n",
    "LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that:\n",
    "- Adds trainable low-rank matrices to frozen model weights\n",
    "- Reduces memory requirements by 90%+\n",
    "- Enables fine-tuning large models on consumer GPUs\n",
    "- Produces small adapter files (~100-500MB for 8B models)\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this workshop is not the specifics of LoRA, but to actually give everyone an guide on how to carry out the process of tuning your model. "

    "**NeMo Compatibility**: \n",
    "- The downloaded model uses standard NeMo format (.nemo file)\n",
    "- The training scripts work directly without any modifications\n",
