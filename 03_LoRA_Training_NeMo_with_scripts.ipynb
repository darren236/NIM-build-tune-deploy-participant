    "### Why Baseline Metrics Might Not Show\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Note**: The test metrics table might not appear in the baseline check because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generation vs Evaluation Mode**: \n",
    "   - `megatron_gpt_generate.py` is optimized for text generation\n",
    "   - It only calculates loss when it has the full context (during training)\n",
    "   - Without training, it focuses on generation only\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **No Training = No Loss Calculation**:\n",
    "   - Loss requires comparing predictions to ground truth token-by-token\n",
    "   - This happens naturally during training (teacher forcing)\n",
    "   - Pure inference/generation doesn't always compute this\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Alternative Approaches**:\n",
    "   - Run training for 0 steps to get initial loss\n",
    "   - Use a dedicated evaluation script\n",
    "   - Compare generated text quality instead of numerical metrics\n",

    "**1. Tokenizer Warnings** (those repeated messages):\n",
    "These are harmless warnings from HuggingFace. What's happening:\n",
    "- NeMo uses multiprocessing to speed up data loading\n",
    "- Each process needs its own tokenizer instance\n",
    "- The warning is just saying 'Hey, I'm disabling parallel tokenization to avoid conflicts'\n",

    "`Testing DataLoader 0: 100%|‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà| 2/2`\n",
    "- Processed both test examples\n",
    "- Took about 11 seconds (0.17 items/second)\n",
    "- This is SLOW because we're generating 100 tokens per example\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Results Saved**:\n",
    "`Predictions saved to customer_support_lora_test_customer_support_inputs_preds_labels.jsonl`\n",
    "- This file contains the model's actual responses!\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Test Metrics Table**:\n",
    "- `test_loss: 2.427` - This is the perplexity loss on test data\n",
    "- Lower is better (1.0 would be perfect)\n",
    "- 2.4 is actually quite good for a small LoRA adapter!\n",
    "\n",
    "The test metrics table shows your LoRA model's **loss score** (lower is better), which measures how different the model's predictions are from your training examples. A score of **0-1 is excellent** (but may indicate memorization), **1-2.5 is good** (your 2.427 falls here!), **2.5-4 is okay**, and **4+ needs work**. When you see this table, you're looking for a loss between 1-3, which means the model learned your style without memorizing exact phrases - perfect for real-world use. If your loss is too high (>4), try: increasing training steps, adding more diverse training examples, or raising the learning rate. If it's too low (<1), you might be overfitting - reduce training steps or add dropout. The fact that all three values (test_loss, test_loss_customer_support, val_loss) are identical just means we're using one small test set. Your 2.427 score indicates the model successfully learned the customer service style and will generalize well to new customer questions! \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why they're identical:\n",
    "- test_loss: The average loss across ALL test datasets\n",
    "- test_loss_customer_support: The loss for your specific \"customer_support\" test set\n",
    "- val_loss: Validation loss (but in inference mode, it uses test data)\n",
    "\n",
    "They're the same because:\n",
    "- You only have ONE test dataset (customer_support)\n",
    "- So the \"average of all datasets\" = \"customer_support dataset\" = same number\n",
    "- In inference/test mode, validation and test use the same data\n",
