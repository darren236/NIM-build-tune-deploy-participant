# Understanding NeMo Framework & NeMo 2 Format

## What is NVIDIA NeMo?

NVIDIA NeMo (Neural Modules) is a comprehensive framework ecosystem for building, training, and deploying large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI models. Let's clarify the different components:

### The NeMo Ecosystem

#### 1. **NeMo Framework (Core Library)**
The Python library you install and import:
```python
pip install nemo-toolkit
import nemo
```
- Provides high-level APIs for model training
- Built on PyTorch Lightning
- Includes pre-built model architectures
- Handles distributed training automatically

#### 2. **NeMo GitHub Repository**
What we cloned in the workshop:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo.git
```
- Contains source code for the framework
- Includes example scripts (what we use for training)
- Has model implementations
- Provides utilities and tools

#### 3. **NeMo Models**
Pre-trained models available on NGC:
- Named with "nemo" suffix (e.g., `llama-3_2-1b-instruct-nemo`)
- Optimized for NVIDIA hardware
- Available in both old (.nemo) and new (.distcp) formats

#### 4. **NeMo Guardrails**
Separate product for AI safety:
```python
pip install nemoguardrails
```
- Adds safety layers to LLM applications
- Prevents harmful outputs
- Enforces topic boundaries
- Different from core NeMo Framework

#### 5. **NeMo Curator**
Data curation toolkit:
- Cleans and prepares training data
- Deduplicates datasets
- Filters low-quality content
- Essential for large-scale training

#### 6. **NeMo Aligner**
RLHF and alignment tools:
- Implements PPO, DPO, and other alignment methods
- Fine-tunes models based on human preferences
- Part of the broader NeMo ecosystem

### Why Both Library and Repository?

**Library Installation:**
```bash
pip install nemo-toolkit[all]  # Full installation
pip install nemo-toolkit[nlp]  # Just NLP components
```
- Good for using pre-built functionality
- Stable releases
- Easy dependency management

**GitHub Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo.git
cd NeMo && pip install -e .
```
- Access to latest features
- Can modify source code
- Contains example scripts
- More flexibility for research

**In This Workshop:**
- We use the **GitHub repository** for training scripts
- We don't install the full library (takes 20-30 minutes)
- The scripts work with our existing PyTorch environment
- Production deployments would use the pip-installed version

## NeMo 2 Distributed Checkpoint Format

Now that we understand the NeMo ecosystem, let's dive into the specific checkpoint format used by NeMo 2...

## What is NeMo 2 Format?

The NeMo 2 distributed checkpoint format is NVIDIA's newer, more efficient way of storing large language models. Unlike the older single-file format, it splits models into manageable shards for better performance and scalability.

### Format Comparison

**Old Format (NeMo 1):**
```
model.nemo  (single file, e.g., 15GB)
```

**New Format (NeMo 2):**
```
llama-3_2-1b-instruct_v2.0/
├── context/
│   ├── model.yaml         # Model architecture config
│   ├── io.json           # I/O configuration
│   └── nemo_tokenizer/   # Tokenizer files
└── weights/
    ├── .metadata         # Checkpoint metadata
    ├── __0_0.distcp     # Model weights shard 1
    ├── __0_1.distcp     # Model weights shard 2
    └── common.pt        # Shared parameters
```

## Why the Change?

### 1. **Distributed Training Support**
- Modern models (70B, 175B parameters) can't fit on single GPUs
- Natural support for model parallelism
- Each GPU loads only its portion of the model

### 2. **Faster Loading**
- Parallel loading of different shards
- No need to load entire model then redistribute
- Reduced memory pressure during initialization

### 3. **Efficient Storage**
- Better compression algorithms
- Deduplication of repeated weights
- Easier incremental updates

## Real-World Example

For Llama 3.2 1B model:
```
weights/
├── __0_0.distcp    # 1.2GB - First shard (layers 0-15)
├── __0_1.distcp    # 1.2GB - Second shard (layers 16-31)
├── common.pt       # 2.8KB - Shared weights (embeddings, etc.)
└── metadata.json   # Shard loading configuration
```

## Key Advantages

### Training on Multiple GPUs
```python
# Old way: Load entire model, then split
model = load_model("model.nemo")  # 15GB on GPU 0
model = split_for_gpus(model)     # Complex redistribution!

# New way: Each GPU loads its shard directly
gpu0.load("__0_0.distcp")  # 1.2GB
gpu1.load("__0_1.distcp")  # 1.2GB
```

### LoRA Integration
- LoRA adapters seamlessly add to existing shards
- No need to merge into monolithic file
- Dynamic adapter swapping at runtime

# Right: MODEL="path/to/model_directory/"
```

**Q: How do I verify checkpoint integrity?**
A: 
```bash
# Check all shards exist
ls -la model_dir/weights/*.distcp

# Verify metadata
cat model_dir/weights/metadata.json
```

**Q: Can I mix checkpoint versions?**
A: No! All shards must be from the same checkpoint. The metadata.json ensures version consistency.

### Advanced Topics
