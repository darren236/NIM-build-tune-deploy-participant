# LoRA YAML Configuration Clarification

## The Issue
The notebook creates a detailed YAML configuration file (`lora_config.yaml`) but doesn't actually use it during training. This could confuse users.

## What Actually Happens

### 1. YAML File Creation (Section 4)
- A comprehensive YAML configuration is created
- Saved to `lora_tutorial/configs/lora_config.yaml`
- Contains all LoRA training parameters

### 2. Actual Training (Section 5)
- Uses command line arguments directly:
  ```bash
  model.peft.lora_tuning.adapter_dim=32
  model.optim.lr=5e-4
  # etc...
  ```
- Does NOT load or reference the YAML file

### 3. Where YAML is Used
- Only in the educational template script `train_lora_template.py`
- This template is never executed - it's just for learning

## Why This Approach?

**Benefits of Command Line Arguments:**
- Maximum flexibility
- Easy to modify without editing files
- Clear what parameters are being used
- Standard practice in production
- Allows quick experimentation

**Benefits of YAML Files:**
- Good for documentation
- Helps understand parameter structure
- Can save standard configurations
- Useful for complex nested configs

## Updates Made

1. **Section 4 Title**: Added "(For Educational Purposes)" to clarify intent
2. **Added Note**: Explains that YAML is for understanding, CLI args for execution
3. **Post-Training Note**: New markdown cell explaining why we didn't use the YAML
4. **Template Comment**: Clarified that only the template uses the YAML file

## Best Practice
In production, you might:
1. Create YAML files for standard configurations
2. Use CLI arguments to override specific values
3. Combine both: `--config-path=config.yaml model.optim.lr=1e-3`

This gives you both reproducibility and flexibility!
