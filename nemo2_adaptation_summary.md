# NeMo 2.0 Adaptation Summary

## Changes Made to Support NeMo 2.0

### 1. Model Format Compatibility
- The downloaded Llama 3.2 1B model uses NeMo 2.0 distributed checkpoint format
- This format includes:
  - `weights/` directory with `.distcp` files  
  - `context/` directory with `model.yaml` configuration
- The training scripts are backward compatible and can load this format

### 2. Notebook Updates

#### 03_LoRA_Training_NeMo_with_scripts.ipynb
1. **Added NeMo version compatibility notes** explaining that:
   - Downloaded model is in NeMo 2.0 format
   - Training scripts support both NeMo 1.0 and 2.0 formats
   
2. **Enhanced model verification** to show NeMo 2.0 checkpoint structure:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Llama 3.2 1B model found (NeMo 2.0 distributed checkpoint)
   üìÅ NeMo 2.0 Checkpoint Structure:
      lora_tutorial/models/llama-3_2-1b-instruct/llama-3_2-1b-instruct_v2.0/
      ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ weights/     # Contains .distcp files (distributed checkpoint)
      ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ context/     # Contains model.yaml configuration
   ```

3. **Added NeMo 2.0 API example** showing the modern approach:
   ```python
   # NeMo 2.0 API for LoRA training
   llm.finetune(
       model=model_path,  # Can load from path directly
       data=data,
       trainer=trainer,
       peft=peft_config,
       optim=optimizer,
   )
   ```

4. **Updated training script** to explicitly check for NeMo 2.0 format and provide better error messages

### 3. Two Training Approaches

The notebook now presents two approaches:

1. **Script-based (Recommended for Workshop)**
   - Uses `megatron_gpt_finetuning.py` script
   - Works with minimal dependencies
   - Automatically handles NeMo 2.0 checkpoint format
   
2. **API-based (Modern NeMo 2.0)**
   - Uses `llm.finetune()` API
   - Requires full NeMo installation
   - More programmatic control

### 4. Key Benefits of NeMo 2.0
- Native distributed checkpoint support
- Simplified APIs for fine-tuning
- Better integration with model parallelism
- Direct path loading without conversion

### 5. Backward Compatibility
The workshop maintains full backward compatibility:
- Training scripts detect and handle both formats automatically
- No changes required to existing workflows
- Same LoRA adapter output format

## Result
The workshop now seamlessly works with NeMo 2.0 distributed checkpoints while maintaining simplicity for workshop participants. Users can choose between the simple script-based approach or explore the modern API-based approach based on their needs.
