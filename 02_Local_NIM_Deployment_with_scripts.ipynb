Think of this like translating a book into your native language - it makes everything run much more smoothly on your specific GPU. TensorRT is NVIDIA's secret sauce that can make models run up to 6 times faster than their original format.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next comes Memory Mapping. We're dealing with models that can be several gigabytes in size - imagine trying to read a massive book all at once! Instead of loading everything into memory, the container uses a clever technique called memory mapping. It's like having a really efficient bookmark system where you can instantly jump to any page without having to flip through the entire book. This means we can work with huge models even with limited GPU memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then we have the Warmup phase. This is where the container prepares all the CUDA kernels - think of it like a chef preparing their mise en place before service starts. Every mathematical operation the model might need is compiled and cached, ensuring that when we actually start serving requests, everything runs at peak performance. Without this warmup, the first few requests would be slower as the operations get compiled on demand.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we launch the API Server. We're using FastAPI, a modern, fast web framework, but here's the clever part - the endpoints are completely compatible with OpenAI's API format. This means if you've ever written code for ChatGPT's API, it will work with our local deployment with minimal changes. Just change the API URL and key, and you're good to go!\n",
